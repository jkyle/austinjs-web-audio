This project is an example of using React to compose and drive WebAudio components.

To run this project, first install the dependencies with

`npm install`

then, start the dev server with

`npm start`.

This project has a number of different branches leading up to `15-final`. I recommend starting on that branch.

It's been tested with Node v7.1 and Chrome v65.
